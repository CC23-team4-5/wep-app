You are being invited to participate in a research study about powering up crowdsourcing workflows by Large Language Models. This study is being executed by Garrett Allen, Zhiqiang Lei, Krzysztof Garbowicz, Eleni Papadopoulou, Alex de Los Santos Subirats and Stijn Ponsioen from the TU Delft, as part of the course Crowdsourcing Computing.

The purpose of this research study is to gain insights into the effects of Large Language Models within crowdsourcing workflows. To gather these insights, you will be asked to perform one step of a text summarization process: Extract, Produce, or Verify. After finishing your task, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire regarding your experience completing the task. For your time to perform this task, you will be compensated via the Prolific platform.
